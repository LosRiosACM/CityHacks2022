</p>


<p>
The website is coded in HTML5 CSS and Bootstrap5. You can use Javascript to do more cooler animations with the Three.js and Anime.js libraries for example.
If you want to use this site for your future hackathons please fork this repository.
If you need help to code this website out please look at the resources page and under Web Development Resources for some tutorials to help you understand the code.

<p>
The cool accordion and navbar that you see are made with Bootstrap5.

<h2>Those weird card things lool really hard to code how did you make it?</h2>
<p>
  The nice looking cards (rounded divs with a drop shadow) are designed using this CSS generator:

<h2>How do you Redirect to a certain div of a page?</h2>
<p>
    You can use the id of the div you want to redirect to.
    For example, if you want to redirect to the div with id "about" you would use the following code:
    <code>
        <a href="#about">About</a>
    </code>
</p>

<h2>How did you get the Fonts like that?</h2>
<p>I imported the Google Fonts font embedding library to give the website a font not found in default CSS.</p>
